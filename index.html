            <p> MKCreations was established as a business entity summer of 2018, but really started many years earlier. Mary has always enjoyed being creative both in her personal and professional life. Capturing creative photos started around 1993 with the birth of her first son. With a camera in hand, her view of the world changed and details emerged in a way never seen before. It was as if a new view of everyday life emerged.<br><br>Around 2000 she shifted to using a DSLR camera and with the ability to see images right away, without waiting to develop them, the world became her canvas. Mary loves to capture the details of common everyday things and show them in a special light.<br><br>Building websites has also interested Mary for many years and she has dabbled in updating sites both as a volunteer and in her professional life. She has contributed content and updated design for better layout and navigation. Summer 2018, she decided to take a class to obtain the necessary skills to create her own websites. This is her first site built from the ground up.
